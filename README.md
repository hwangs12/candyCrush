This is a candy crush game.
Code-along project from Ania Kubow's Youtube Channel
There are some bugs
3 by 3 match don't work
4 by 4 match don't work
anything that is length longer than 3 with match don't work if there are any matching pair outside of the straight line of length 3 or 4
if ideally, matched 3 by 3 or 4 by 3 or 4 by 4, the line falling down from the top is not completed as expected.
